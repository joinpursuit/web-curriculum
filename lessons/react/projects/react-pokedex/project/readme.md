### React Pokedex
For this project you will create a pokedex app using ReactJS, jQuery (for AJAX requests) and Bootstrap. The following is the approximate layout of the app:

<img src="pokedex.png" width="400px" />



Below the title to the left is a list of all pokemon, and above it is a search field which filters the list in real time. To the right is some info of the selected pokemon.

You are given the incomplete file `index.js`. Complete the methods for the given react components.

* Pokedex
 * PokemonSearch
 * PokemonList
 * PokemonInfo

Use the comments in the code as a guide.

The main url for the API is: https://pokeapi.co/.
An example url for a pokemon with the name 'pikachu': http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu.

To start the app, use the command line: "node server" from the project folder and then go on a browser to http://localhost:3000/.
