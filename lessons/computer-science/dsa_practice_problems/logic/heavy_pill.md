# Question
You have 10 bottles of pills, 9 bottles contain 1.0 gram pills, but one contains pill weighing 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once. You can take the pills out of the bottle.

# Answer
Take one pill from one bottle, two pills from the second bottle...
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
However much the actual weight differs from 55 will tell us which bottle the heavier pills came from. For example, if the weight is over by .5 grams, we know there are five 1.1 gram pills on the scale. Therefore, the heavy pills must have come from the fifth bottle.
